He has been fantastic for his new team to begin the season, producing MVP caliber numbers on a nightly basis. Something to note is that he appears to have done some work on his free-throw efficiency across the off-season. In what was was basically the only weakness to his fantasy game, James has now shot a combined 39-of-49, going at almost 80 percent. While this is certainly not spectacular, it is up almost 7 percent from 73 percent last season.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/players/400553/lebron-james/">James</a> finished with 35 points (13-21 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 7-8 FT), 11 rebounds, four assists, and two steals in 34 minutes during Saturday's 120-116 loss to San Antonio.</p>, <p>James shot an impressive 13-of-21 from the field Saturday, finishing with 35 points to go with 11 rebounds. The <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/LAL/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a> fell to 2-and-4 with this loss despite the impressive start to the season by James. From a fantasy outlook, it appears James is going to be just fine no matter the winning record and he should be able to return top 10 value quite easily once all is said and done.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/players/400553/lebron-james/">James</a> offered 28 points (10-17 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 7-10 FT), 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals across 35 minutes in the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/LAL/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a>' 121-114 win over the Nuggets on Thursday.</p>, <p>James was in vintage form while leading the short-handed Lakers to a second straight win, and he accomplished his first triple-double of the season against one of the stingiest defenses in the league. The King has now gone for at least a double-double in three straight contests, helping lead to averages of 25.8 points (on 47.9 percent shooting), 9.2 assists, 8.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals across 36.4 minutes over his first five contests in his new digs.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/players/400553/lebron-james/">James</a> had 19 points (7-16 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 4-4 FT), 10 assists, seven rebounds, and three steals in 28 minutes during Wednesday's 131-113 victory over the Suns.</p>, <p>James was somewhat subdued on the offensive end, scoring just 19 points but adding double-digit dimes. In what was his first victory in a <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/LAL/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a> uniform, James also saw reduced playing time in the comfortable victory. He has had plenty of ups and downs across his first week as a Laker but certainly appears to have brought showtime back to Los Angeles. He will get the night off Wednesday before facing the unbeaten Denver Nuggets in what is sure to be an entertaining fixture.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/players/400553/lebron-james/">James</a> posted 32 points (11-25 FG, 2-8 3Pt, 8-11 FT), 14 assists, eight rebounds, one steal and one block across 43 minutes in the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/LAL/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a>' 143-142 overtime loss to the Spurs on Monday.</p>, <p>Unsurprisingly, James was involved in two of the instant classic's most pivotal plays. His three-pointer with 2.4 seconds left in regulation knotted the game at 128, eventually sending it into overtime. However, his pair of missed free throws with 12.8 seconds remaining in the extra period helped sink the Lakers, as the Spurs' Patty Mills subsequently drained a go-ahead jumper that gave San Antonio the lead for good. It was a crushing turn of events for the perennial MVP candidate in what was only his second game in his new digs, and it marred what was an otherwise stellar performance. James and his teammates, who will continue to play without the services of both Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo for several more games due to their respective suspensions, will dust themselves off and attempt to bounce back against the Suns on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="site-footer-dates">Â© 2005-2018 CBS INTERACTIVE.

[<p>With several national pundits, including more than a few Las Vegas sports books, expecting <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/lebron-james-PESPT008359-topic.html" id="PESPT008359" title="LeBron James">LeBron James</a> to be in contact with the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/" id="ORSPT000190" title="Miami Heat">Miami Heat</a> as he considers his future, the former Heat forward said he has yet to finalize his game plan for what happens in the wake of being swept out of the <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/nba-finals-EVSPR000114-topic.html" id="EVSPR000114" title="NBA Finals">NBA Finals</a> by the <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-ORSPT000100-topic.html" id="ORSPT000100" title="Golden State Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>.</p>, <p>"I have no idea at this point," James said early Saturday in Cleveland, eligible to become a free agent on July 1, as well as potentially positioned to force a trade in advance. "The one thing that I've always done is considered, obviously, my family, understanding especially where my boys are at this point in their age. They were a lot younger the last time I made a decision like this four years ago. I've got a teenage boy, a pre-teen and a little girl that wasn't around as well.</p>, <p>"So sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I'll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that. So I don't have an answer for you right now as far as that."</p>, <p>ESPN reported the Heat among the teams James will speak with, as well as the <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/cleveland-cavaliers-ORSPT000001141-topic.html" id="ORSPT000001141" title="Cleveland Cavaliers">Cavaliers</a>, Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/boston-celtics-ORSPT000094-topic.html" id="ORSPT000094" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>, <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/houston-rockets-ORSPT000101-topic.html" id="ORSPT000101" title="Houston Rockets">Houston Rockets</a> and Los Angeles Lakers.</p>, <p>The Heat currently lack the needed salary-cap space to sign James as a free agent, which would otherwise mean attempting to formulate a trade with the Cavaliers. The Heat have been aggressive even in the lack of needed cap space in recent years with the failed free-agency pursuits of Kevin Durant and <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/gordon-hayward-PESPT0000010774-topic.html" id="PESPT0000010774" title="Gordon Hayward">Gordon Hayward</a>.</p>, <p>James said the next step is formulating his approach.</p>, <p>"Well, I mean, I'm not going to take you throughout the whole process," he said. "That's not fun. But at the end of the day, like I said, when I decide what I'm going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so. Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we'll see what happens."</p>, <p>After starting his <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/nba-15008001-topic.html" id="15008001" title="NBA">NBA</a> career as the No. 1 overall pick by his home-area Cavaliers in 2003, James moved on to the Heat in 2010 NBA free agency, before returning to Cleveland as a free agent in 2014.</p>, <p>Of his previous decisions, James said, "I feel like '10 was the toughest."</p>, <p>He then advanced to four consecutive NBA Finals with the Heat, winning championships in 2012 and '13. That was followed by these past four visits to the Finals with Cleveland, winning the 2016 title with the Cavaliers.</p>, <p>"At the end of the day, I came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business," he said of delivering a championship to Northeast Ohio. "To be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember. Honestly, I think we'll all remember that. It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we'll all remember that in sports history."</p>, <p>The question for the Heat is whether they stand anywhere as attractive as when Heat president Pat Riley lured James in 2010.</p>, <p>"I made the move in 2010 to be able to play with talented players, cerebral players that you could see things that happen before they happened on the floor, and your teammate can do the same throughout the course of a season, throughout the course of a game, throughout the course of a playoffs, throughout the course of a Finals," James said. "So when you feel like you're really good at your craft, I think it's always great to be able to be around other great minds as well and other great ballplayers, in my instance, and other great just, I think, studies of the game itself.</p>, <p>"That's never changed. Even when I came here in '14, I wanted to try to surround myself and surround this franchise with great minds and guys that actually think outside the box of the game and not just go out and play it."</p>, <p> </p>, <p>November 2, 2018</p>, <p>Q: So Goran Dragic has to take cortisone shots. Oh boy, here we go. . . . -- William.</p>, <p>A: Well, the good part is that when I asked Goran whether a surgical solution could be a possible answer to his ongoing foot issue, he shot me the least-friendly of looks (don't worry, I'm not...</p>, <p>It ultimately could come down to whether James, 33, attempts to continue to build with the Cavaliers or seeks the type of fresh start he did by joining <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/chris-bosh-PESPT008829-topic.html" id="PESPT008829" title="Chris Bosh">Chris Bosh</a> and <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/dwyane-wade-PESPT008417-topic.html" id="PESPT008417" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> with the Heat in 2010.</p>, <p>"Well, it's definitely not the most comfortable thing to start a team from scratch, because the most important is health," he said, "because you need to build chemistry so fast and camaraderie so fast on the floor. And if you have multiple injuries or you have multiple bodies out, when you're starting fresh, it's too hard.</p>, <p>"I think with this season, that's what you kind of saw. The difference between this season and the difference between my first year in Miami, we didn't have many injuries at all. And we were definitely fresh together. But myself and D-Wade and Bosh, you know, UD (<a href="/topic/sports/basketball/udonis-haslem-PESPT008835-topic.html" id="PESPT008835" title="Udonis Haslem">Udonis Haslem</a>), <a href="/topic/sports/basketball/mike-miller-PESPT005059-topic.html" id="PESPT005059" title="Mike Miller">Mike Miller</a> had a few injuries, but [<a href="/topic/sports/basketball/mario-chalmers-PESPT008837-topic.html" id="PESPT008837" title="Mario Chalmers">Mario] Chalmers</a> was available, and pretty much our team, we were pretty solid as far as being injury — not being injury-prone.</p>, <p>"Obviously, my first year back here we were headed in the right direct, and then we hit the postseason. Kev (<a href="/topic/sports/basketball/kevin-love-PESPT0000010823-topic.html" id="PESPT0000010823" title="Kevin Love">Kevin Love</a>) had a separated shoulder, and then Kyrie [Irving] goes down in the first, second possession of overtime of Game 1 in the Finals. So, I mean, that's just huge. So being a part of the start-fresh mode is something that you definitely don't want to be a part of. It has its pros and it definitely has its cons."</p>, <p>Even James' current teammates aren't sure what will come next.</p>, <p>"It's something where I'm sure he will spend time with his family and when that times comes to make a decision, he will be in a good frame of mind," Love said. "Obviously, I'd love to play with LeBron the rest of my career, but that will be a choice that he makes."</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat defending vs. pace.</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat defending vs. pace.</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat defending vs. pace.</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat defending vs. pace.</p>, <p>Dwyane Wade on Derrick Rose's 50-point night</p>, <p>Dwyane Wade on Derrick Rose's 50-point night</p>, <p>Josh Richardson on defending at pace.</p>, <p>Josh Richardson on defending at pace.</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat: We have to get back to work</p>, <p>Erik Spoelstra on Heat: We have to get back to work</p>, <p>Dwyane Wade says work remains for Heat</p>, <p>Dwyane Wade says work remains for Heat</p>, <p><strong><em><a href="mailto:iwinderman@sunsentinel.com" target="_blank">iwinderman@sunsentinel.com</a>.

[<p>With the score tied in the closing seconds Wednesday at Staples Center, Mavericks guard Wesley Matthews was called for a foul on Lakers star LeBron James, who sank a game-winning free throw with 2.1 seconds left. “I believe he did (know the situation), and I believe he just got aggressive,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said of Matthews. Said Matthews, “I can't put us in a position for [the officials] to make that call. I knew the situation, wanted to make a play. I was ready to make a play. I can't put us in a position for them to make that call.”</p>, <p>Mavericks rookie sensation Luka Dončić said he talked to Lakers star LeBron James during Wednesday's game at Staples Center about getting his jersey afterward, which Dončić did. "I always wanted his jersey," Dončić said of a player that he has long idolized. "It was something special to me." LeBron signed it, in part, with the message, "Strive For Greatness." Of his matchup with James, Dončić said, "It's special. It's very special. I was waiting for this game, and it was very special to me."</p>, <p>LeBron James scored 29 points and made the game-winning free throw with 2.1 seconds left as the Los Angeles Lakers held on for a 114-113 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.</p>, <p>The Lakers hope JaVale McGee will be The Grinch tonight at the rim defensively.</p>, <p>LeBron James arrived to the game as Jason for Halloween.</p>, <p>Michael Beasley remains with family and away from the team.
